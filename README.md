## Database Entity Diagram


## Marketing

The site is B2C focused - I asked the following questrions:

- What are your site users requirements?

  To support and give to a charity they feel is deserving

- What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?

  A clear display of the horses that require support and donations

- How can you make the information easy to understand?

  Intuitive and clear design, high quality clear images, clear and descriptive titles, simple payment process, simple signup/login/logout process.

- Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?

  Home page, nav bar, custom product pages would also link back to primary shop page. Error pages also link back to shop page.

- Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?

  There would be opportunities to link up to other animal welfare sites.

- Who are your users? 
  Equine enthusiasts, animal lovers.

Marketing Strategies:

 - Facebook page - I created a facebook page to engage with a far reaching audience and attract follows. - [Click Here](https://www.facebook.com/EmbarrEquineTherapy/)
 - Newsletter sign up - A site user can sign up for a monthly newsletter (Please note this function is not fully live - it requires further development - for now it is just an empty form on the site)
 - There is potential to promote open days, or encouraging people to volunteer and help on the farm - this is mentioned in the About us section.

## SEO

SEO implementation, including:
- A robots.txt file
- A sitemap.xml file
- Descriptive meta tags
- rel attributes on links to external resources
- Content
- Keywords in the metatags: "Horses, Ponies, Mares, Geldings, Retired, Charity, Donations, Equestrian, Rescue, Animals"


## Site Features 

- __Navigation Bar__

  Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page and all sub pages - About, Blog, Horses, the shopping cart and User Account, it is identical in structure for each page to allow for easy navigation. When the user logs in,the signin/up link is replaced with the logout link. The navigation items are styled to transition to a hamburger menu when the site is reduced in size on a mobile device. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
